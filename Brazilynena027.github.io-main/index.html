        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my ePortfolio. I am Danielle Sousa, a dedicated and passionate professional with over 
        15 years in the Electrical field. My passion for this industry has driven me to continually seek growth 
        and new challenges, which led me to pursue a deeper understanding of technology through the Computer Science 
        program.</p>
        <p> This portfolio gives a glimpse of my journey, highlighting my dedication to personal and professional
        developement, showcasing the achievements I have accomplished and demonstrating the technical and problem-solving
        skills I have sharpened throughout my career and education.By no means has this been easy, 
        and at times it has tested my abilities in software development, but I can honestly say that this has been a very rewarding experience,
        and I am proud of my accomplishments thus far.  This degree program has opened my mind to systematic thinking and has enhanced my problem-solving skills.     
        </p>
        <p>Throughout my coursework, specifically in Introduction to Programming, I have sharpened my ability to write clean and efficient code in languages such as Python and Java. 
        In the Data Structures course, I created a sorting algorithm that was included in my project that improves performance.  
        Projects such as maze-solving robots in Artificial Intelligence require me to implement solutions that use search algorithms to get the robot to the end of the maze. 
        This course showcased my ability to think analytically and troubleshoot issues.</p>
        <p>In the Software Development lifecycle course, acting as individual contributors in the lifecycle course through a series of journals, I was able to describe effectively
        how each member contributes to communication and collaboration among team members, stakeholders, and clients. In software engineering, I worked with a diverse team to implement an application 
        using Agile methodologies. This included sprint planning meetings in which I got positive feedback from my instructor.</p>
        <p>In the DAD-220 course Intro to Struct Database, I had to create a database that held tables by using SQL commands.  I created several tables, such as Customers, that store customer information 
        with a primary key of a customer ID. Created a table for Orders that have fields with Order ID, customer ID, SKU, and Description. This course has allowed me to gain invaluable foundational skills in database systems.
        In the course CS-305 Software Security, we were tasked with a project for a fictional client called Artemis Financial to assess their software security needs.  I had to perform tasks such as vulnerability assessments, 
        mitigation planning, and implement secure coding practices such as checksum verification and input sanitization.</p>
        <p>The artifacts presented in this ePortfolio are a visual representation of three artifacts from the CS-360 course, Mobile Architecture and Programming, that best highlight my skills and abilities learned at SNHU. 
        In my Software Design and Engineering artifact, I was able to enhance the user interfaces to be more user-friendly and well-structured. In the second artifact for Algorithms and Data structures, 
        I was able to improve software efficiency by introducing a hash map that enhances performance and responsiveness using efficient data to support decision making that provides readily available data to different audiences. 
        Lastly. My third artifact for databases was implementing a cache that will improve the efficiency of accessing data, which makes it more responsive and easier to use by different audiences.</p>
        <p>This ePortfolio encapsulates the skills and achievements gained through my time at SNHU. Each artifact reflects the commitment to create effective solutions. These artifacts demonstrate proficiency in software design and engineering, 
        algorithms and data structures, and Database management that symbolizes a milestone in my personal and professional growth. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my work.</p>

        <h2>Narratives</h2

             <p>Enhancements One,Two and Three artifact The artifact is an Events tracking app that was created in the CS-360 course Mobile Architecture and Programming in Android Studio using Java code. 
                The goal of the application is to track events that are logged by the user to a calendar on the user’s mobile phone. The user can Add, delete or update existing events in SQL Lite database. 
                When the event is approaching its start time an SMS notification will be sent to the user to notify them of the upcoming event as a reminder. 
                This artifact was created in April of 2024. </p>
             <p>I chose this artifact for several reasons. One, when I developed this app, I had not completed it functionality and I thought this would be a great way to showcase my abilities in what I have learned throughout my time at SNHU. 
                Secondly, since it had been some time since this application was created it would allow me to reacquaint myself with the material and IDE and get morehands-on time with this artifact. 
                In Enhancement One, The specific components that showcase my skill and abilities in the Software Design and Engineering portion are within the user interface portion of the application under activity_main_login and activity_register xml files as well as the MainActivityLogin and RegisterActivity file code which is the functionality of the user interfaces for login in a user and signing up a user for a new account. 
                The artifact was improved by adding more visuals to the main login page and sign-up page, such as an icon representing what the page is about. I also implemented a password recovery link and a Remember me check box on the login screen. For the password recovery link, I had to create a new class for forgotpassword to give functionality to the forgot password link on the login screen. 
                I also added code to the MainActivityLogin file for the Remember me check box to add functionality to populate the username and password fields if the box is checked by the user. I decided to keep the footer and header however, I did minor changes to the color of the buttons.</p>
             <p>In Enhancement Two, The specific components that showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and datastructures are in the Event database, DateUtils class files, and Date_event_controls.xml. In the date_event_controls xml. I rewrote this code because initially there wasn’t much to this page. I implemented a date and time picker to show a calendar and clock for the user to choose the date and time of the event. 
                I added an Edit text field for the title of the event and description, and buttons to submit or cancel the event. The Event Database allows users and events to be added, updated, deleted, and retrieved. For user management, it allows user authentication, registration, and retrieval. For event management, there is data consistency through caching, foreign key constraints and logging errors. I created a DateUtil class to make it easier to handle date logic. 
                This makes sure it is in one place and avoids code being repeated in other parts of my application. Also, the class can be reused in parts where date operations are needed. Overall, it is just a better organization of my code. The artifact was improved by the separation of concerns (ardalis. (n.d.), meaning that I was able to separate the data handling logic. Where the Event database focuses on events and user management, cache and database interactions.
                The cache helps to reduce the database queries by storing regularly accessed data in memory, which improves the performance when retrieving users or events. I also implemented an Event Database Unit test that uses a mock database to test the add event method using Mockito to help ensure that the cache is working an intended. </p>
             <p>In Enhancement Three, The specific components that showcase my skills and abilities are where I use HashMap, which is a form of a hash table. The event Cache is implemented using alinked hash map, which maintains the order of entries for events. Another area that I have concentrated on is security. I implemented SQLCipher, which is used to encrypt the database with an encryption key that keeps the data protected and inaccessible without the key. 
                I also use Optional, which handles null values safely.</p>
             <p>With the inclusion of all three artifacts I have demonstrated that I was able to meet all 5 course outcomes of:</p>
             <p>Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science</p>
             <p>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts</p>
             <p>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices</p>
             <p>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals</p>
             <p>and, Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources</p>

      <section id="Reflection">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
           <p>What I learned while completing my enhancements were that I had to keep the mindset of error handling. I found this a little challenging because I am not well-versed in this area, and considering all possibilities can take significant time and is easy to overlook. 
              Also, when caching, I do not want to cache sensitive information. This can cause security issues. So, I kept it to event info. I commented out the cache for user info after realizing it could cause security concerns.
              Lastly, when creating and improving my code I had to  keep in mind that I had to balance the security implementation while keeping in mind the performance as well.</p>
